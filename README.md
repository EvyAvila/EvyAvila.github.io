What I did:
I was able to get the general layout of the website from Holo Taco within each row.  
First row: I was able to get the text in the center and the gradient background. The only thing I wasn't able to get exactly was the position
Second row: I was able to get the black background with the color, two dropdowns (first dropdown contains fewer options than original), normal buttons, and a search bar. The main parts I couldn't do was chance the color for the Xs and include the Sign in, S USD, and Bag buttons. 
Third row: There is an animation that plays but I couldn't find it online so I used an image as a placement. I also inserted the text and buttons. However, I was struggling with the position so it's not exact but close enough. 
Fourth row: I have the section of displaying some of the featured products. I selected the first 6 products. They do move as a slider but I had many struggles and was using the internet to help and follow through to make it work. It does not but not in the original way. They display the name of the product, price, and a "button" which isn't really interactive.
Fifth row: At this point I didn't look for images so instead inserted the main function. 3 columns with the title and button for their feature. Besides not inserting an image or design, I didn't have the function of changing the color when hovering over each column. Slightly below is another mini section that contains the main functions. It's only missing an image and an animated background.
Sixth row: I have the main text and an large image of all the images. I didn't get to create a mini gallery so I took  a screenshot of the entire section as a placement. The other thing I didn't do was get the outline for the first two words. 
Seventh row: A small rainbow gradient I was able to replicate.
Eighth row: I was able to get the black background, the image of the logo, and each of the main  sections. Even so, I wasn't able to add the small text under each section, the cards, the copyright text, and product ingredients.

In general, I tried getting the font but it wouldn't display it so I chose the closest font to the original.
