                Ghost is a little floating machine that accompanies the player throughout the game. <br>
                Created by the Traveler, their purpose is to find dead individuals and resurrect them as guardians. They'll gain abilities from the Traveler known as the Light. <br>
                Through a campaign perspective, the Ghost acts as a narrator and voice for the guardian. Additionally, they direct the player where to go and their objective. <br>
                From a gameplay perspective, the Ghost helps the player manuver through different planets and acts as an anchor or respawn point if the player dies. Additionally, they activate or hack doors to allow the player entrance. <br>
                Players have the ability to change their appearance and colors through customization.
