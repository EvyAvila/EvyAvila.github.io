                A clan is a community of players who play <br>
                together to complete any activities such as <br>
                raids, dungeons and more. Players can join <br>
                or be invited into the clan, where each group <br>
                can have up to a max of 100 players. <br><br>
                
                Being part of a clan also provides special <br>
                perks to the player such as rewards for gear <br>
                and weapons. Players may find or be invited <br>
                to a clan by any social or open world places, <br>
                such as the Tower, planets, or through LFG posts.
                <br><br>
                
                To create a clan, the player creates the name, <br>
                customize the clan banner look, and have at least<br>
                one other player join the clan. The person who<br>
                created the clan is known as the leader. The leader<br>
                has the ability to assign admin roles and set the<br>
                entrance policy.

                I'm an admin in the clan called BADD EXAMPLES, <br>
                in which we are a group of chill players who play <br>
                for fun and help each other out. There are no rules <br>
